A tiny Ajax-based chat system.

http://github.com/torus/webchat

SETUP

Webchat is implemented as CGI.  It runs on Apache and lighttpd.

- chmod +x *.cgi
- Set permission of this directory so that the HTTP daemon can create
  a data directory and log files.
- Access index.html from web browser.

When you access index.html for the first time, a data diretory and a
new log file will be generated automatically.

Enjoy!
